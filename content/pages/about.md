Hello! I'm Jackie! I'm a developer and I have been making websites every since I was 12 years old. I love building interactive things but I'm not very good at updating them. 

One thing I've learned is that one needs to put the knowledge into words and share it. We don't know if it will help somebody, somewhere out there. It's very nice to find answers to our problems online. That's why this blog exists! I trully believe someone deperately needs to know how to draw pixel art with CSS Grid!

I'm very into pixel art, even though I'm not good at it. I've build a pixel art editor that renders sprites into HTML and CSS that you can check here (<a href="/">Pixgrid Editor</a>).

As I've mentioned, I've been building websites for a while now. I was very surprised to learn that I'm not very good at it since I've never cared much about accessibility. Since then, web accessibility and inclusive design have been important topics to my career. I'll try to share my findings about the subject here.

Finally, I really need to graduate. It's possible that you'll find some subjects related to Information Systems in this blog.

## About the cat

The cat name is Salem. He's not really sleeping, he is just ignoring you successfully.
